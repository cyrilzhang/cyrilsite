cyrilsite
=========

Template for a minimalistic [personal academic webpage](https://cyrilzhang.com). Features:
- It's one static file. Plays nicely with cheap/free hosting.
- Responsive (i.e. doesn't look completely broken on mobile).
- Uses CSS ```:before```/```content``` to defend against email crawling. Search engines will index the prose only.
- No other features.
